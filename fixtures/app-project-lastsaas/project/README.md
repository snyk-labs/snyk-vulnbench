**The last SaaS boilerplate you'll ever need.**

LastSaaS is a complete, production-ready SaaS foundation built entirely through conversation with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). It gives you multi-tenant account management, authentication, role-based access control, white-label branding, Stripe billing, API keys, outgoing webhooks, a full admin interface, system health monitoring, credit-based usage tracking, and product analytics with telemetry — everything you need to launch a SaaS business, ready to customize for your specific product.

The bottleneck for building software isn't engineering capacity anymore — it's imagination. LastSaaS proves it: a single person with a clear vision and an AI agent can stand up what used to require a team and months of work. And because it was built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), the codebase is fork-ready for agentic engineering — point an AI agent at it and keep building your product through conversation.

## Why LastSaaS Exists

Every SaaS product needs the same boring foundation: user accounts, teams, roles, authentication, admin dashboards, billing, usage limits, branding, webhooks, API keys. Historically, building that foundation meant weeks of plumbing before you could write a single line of your actual product.

LastSaaS eliminates that. Fork it, point an AI agent at it, and start building your product on top of a foundation that already handles:

- Multi-tenant isolation with role-based access
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation
- Google, GitHub, and Microsoft OAuth integration
- Magic link passwordless authentication
- MFA/TOTP with recovery codes
- Email verification and password resets
- Team invitations and member management
- Stripe billing with subscriptions, per-seat pricing, trials, and credit bundles
- Plan entitlements and billing enforcement middleware
- White-label branding with custom themes, logos, landing pages, and custom pages
- API key authentication (admin and user scopes)
- Outgoing webhooks with 19 event types and HMAC-SHA256 signing
- Credit-based usage tracking (subscription + purchased buckets)
- Promotion codes and coupon management via Stripe
- Product analytics dashboard (conversion funnel, KPIs, retention cohorts, engagement metrics)
- Telemetry event system with Go SDK and REST API for custom event tracking
- A full admin interface for managing everything
- Built-in API documentation (HTML and Markdown)
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Financial metrics dashboard (revenue, ARR, DAU, MAU)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI-powered admin access
- CLI tools for server administration
- Auto-versioning with database migrations
- Production deployment on Fly.io

This is open-source infrastructure for the agentic era of software — where the person with the idea is also the person who ships it. The codebase follows consistent patterns that AI agents navigate fluently, so you can keep evolving it the same way it was built.

## How It Compares

If you're evaluating SaaS boilerplates, you've probably looked at ShipFast, Supastarter, MakerKit, SaaS Pegasus, and Gravity. Here's why technical founders choose LastSaaS instead.

**Free and open-source.** ShipFast costs $169, MakerKit runs $199–599, Supastarter starts at $299, SaaS Pegasus charges $249/year, and Gravity is under $1K. LastSaaS is MIT-licensed — fork it, ship it, never pay a license fee. You own the code completely.

**Go backend, not another Next.js project.** ShipFast, Supastarter, MakerKit, and Gravity are all JavaScript/TypeScript stacks. SaaS Pegasus uses Django. LastSaaS pairs a Go backend with a React + TypeScript frontend — giving you compiled-binary deployment, low memory footprint (a 14MB Alpine container), and the concurrency model that Go is known for. If your SaaS will handle real traffic or you want a backend that isn't a Node.js monolith, this matters.

**Genuine multi-tenancy.** ShipFast has no multi-tenancy at all. SaaS Pegasus and Gravity offer basic team features but not true tenant isolation. LastSaaS gives you full multi-tenant architecture: tenant-scoped data isolation, three-tier RBAC (owner/admin/user), team invitations, ownership transfer, per-tenant activity logs, and per-tenant billing. This is the difference between "users can collaborate" and "each customer gets their own isolated workspace."

**White-label branding built in.** Most boilerplates give you a theme toggle at best. LastSaaS includes a full white-label system: custom app name, logo, colors, fonts, landing page, custom pages, CSS injection, favicon, configurable navigation with entitlement gating, and auth page customization. If you're building a platform where customers see your brand (not yours-plus-a-framework), this saves weeks.

**Outgoing webhooks, not just Stripe webhooks.** None of the alternatives — ShipFast, Supastarter, MakerKit, SaaS Pegasus, or Gravity — include an outgoing webhook system. LastSaaS ships with 19 event types across billing, team lifecycle, user lifecycle, credits, and security events, with HMAC-SHA256 signing, delivery tracking, and test events. Your customers can integrate with your platform from day one.

**API keys with scoped access.** ShipFast, Supastarter, and MakerKit don't include API key management. LastSaaS provides `lsk_`-prefixed API keys with admin and user authority scopes, SHA-256 hashed storage, and last-used tracking — ready for your customers to build integrations.

**Health monitoring and financial dashboards.** No competing boilerplate includes system health monitoring. LastSaaS collects CPU, memory, disk, HTTP, and MongoDB metrics every 60 seconds across all nodes, with 8 real-time charts, threshold alerting, and 30-day retention. The financial dashboard gives you revenue, ARR, DAU, and MAU time-series out of the box.

**Product analytics with telemetry.** No competing boilerplate includes product analytics. LastSaaS auto-instruments the customer journey — visitor → signup → plan page → checkout → paid conversion → upgrade — and visualizes it as a conversion funnel. The PM dashboard includes SaaS KPIs (MRR, ARR, ARPU, LTV, churn rate, trial conversion), retention cohort analysis, engagement metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU for paying subscribers), and a custom event explorer. A Go SDK and REST API let you track your own events with zero configuration.

**MCP server for AI-native operations.** This is unique to LastSaaS. A built-in Model Context Protocol server with 32 read-only tools lets you connect Claude (or any MCP-compatible AI) directly to your running application. Query your ARR trend, investigate error spikes, audit API keys, or review system health — all in natural language. No other SaaS boilerplate offers agentic admin access.

**Built for AI-assisted development.** LastSaaS was built entirely through conversation with Claude Code, and the codebase is designed to keep being built that way. Consistent patterns, clear naming, and a structure AI agents navigate fluently. Fork it, point an agent at it, describe your product, and keep going. The competing boilerplates were built for manual development — LastSaaS is built for the way software is made now.

### MCP Server (AI Admin Access)

A built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server gives AI assistants like Claude read-only access to your admin data — dashboards, users, tenants, financials, logs, health, and more. Useful for asking questions like "what's our ARR trend?" or "show me critical logs from the last hour" in natural language.

- **32 read-only tools** across 14 categories — no write operations, safe by design
- **2 resources** — `lastsaas://dashboard` and `lastsaas://health` for automatic context
- **API key authentication** — requires a root-tenant API key, same auth as the admin API
- **Stdio transport** — runs locally, compatible with Claude Desktop and Claude Code

**Tool categories:**
- **About** — software version and environment
- **Dashboard** — user/tenant counts, health overview
- **Tenants** — list with filtering, detailed view with members
- **Users** — list with search, detailed view with auth methods and memberships
- **Financial** — transaction history, revenue/ARR/DAU/MAU time-series metrics
- **Logs** — full-text search with severity/category/date filters, severity counts
- **Health** — current system metrics, time-series health data, node list, integration status
- **Config** — list and inspect runtime configuration variables
- **Plans** — plan details, entitlement keys, credit bundles
- **Announcements** — list published and draft announcements
- **Promotions** — Stripe promotion codes with coupon details
- **Security** — API key inventory (previews only), root tenant members
- **Webhooks** — webhook configs, event type reference, delivery history

### Security
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Request body size limits
- NoSQL injection protection (regex input escaping)
- XSS protection via DOMPurify for injected HTML
- Trusted proxy IP resolution (Fly-Client-IP)
- Webhook signature verification (Stripe inbound, HMAC-SHA256 outbound)
- Idempotent webhook processing via unique event ID index
- System log injection detection with automatic critical alerts
- Refresh token rotation with family-based revocation

### Production Ready
- Dockerized multi-stage build (Go + Node + Alpine)
- Fly.io deployment with auto-stop/auto-start machines
- SPA serving from the Go binary (no separate web server needed)

---

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.25+** — [install](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- **Node.js 22+** — [install](https://nodejs.org)
- **MongoDB** — either:
  - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) (free M0 tier works fine)
  - Local MongoDB Community Edition
- **Git**

### Optional
- [Resend](https://resend.com) API key — for email verification, password resets, and invitations
- Google OAuth credentials — for Google sign-in
- GitHub OAuth credentials — for GitHub sign-in
- Microsoft OAuth credentials — for Microsoft sign-in
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account — for billing (subscriptions, credit purchases, invoices)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io) account — for production deployment

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonradoff/lastsaas.git
cd lastsaas
```

### 2. Run the setup script

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This will prompt you for:
- **Database name** — the project identity (two projects sharing a name share the same user base)
- **MongoDB URI** — your Atlas connection string or `mongodb://localhost:27017`
- **JWT secrets** — auto-generated
- **Google OAuth credentials** — optional, press Enter to skip
- **Resend API key** — optional, press Enter to skip
- **App name and email settings**

It writes a `.env` file and copies the config template.

### 3. Start the backend

```bash
set -a && source .env && set +a
cd backend
go run ./cmd/server
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:4290`.

### 4. Start the frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
set -a && source .env && set +a
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts on `http://localhost:4280`.

### 5. Initialize the system

Run the CLI setup to create the root tenant and admin account:

```bash
cd backend
go run ./cmd/lastsaas setup
```

This creates the root tenant (your admin organization) and the owner account. You can now log in at `http://localhost:4280`.

---

## Setting Up Stripe Billing

Stripe integration is optional but required for paid subscriptions, credit bundle purchases, and invoice generation. If you skip this section, LastSaaS works as a free-tier-only platform.

### 1. Create a Stripe account

Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and complete onboarding. You can use **test mode** during development.

### 2. Get your API keys

Go to **Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys** and copy:
- **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
- **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

### 3. Create a webhook endpoint

Go to **Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint**:

- **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/billing/webhook`
  - For local development with the Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4290/api/billing/webhook`
- **Events to subscribe to** — select these 8 events:
  - `checkout.session.completed`
  - `invoice.paid`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `charge.refunded`
  - `charge.dispute.created`
  - `charge.dispute.closed`

After creating the endpoint, copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`).

### 4. Set environment variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 5. Create plans in the admin UI

Once the backend is running with Stripe configured:
1. Log in as the root tenant owner
2. Go to **Admin → Plans** and create your subscription plans
3. Set pricing, billing intervals, trial days, entitlements, and credit allocations
4. Optionally create **credit bundles** under Admin → Credit Bundles
5. Optionally create **promotion codes** under Admin → Promotions

Stripe Products and Prices are created automatically when customers check out — you don't need to configure anything in the Stripe Dashboard beyond the API keys and webhook.

### 6. Go live

When you're ready for production:
1. Switch to **live mode** in the Stripe Dashboard
2. Create a new webhook endpoint with your production URL and the same 8 events
3. Update your production environment variables with the live keys and webhook secret

---

## Configuration

Config files live in `backend/config/`:
- `dev.example.yaml` / `prod.example.yaml` — committed templates
- `dev.yaml` / `prod.yaml` — your actual configs (gitignored)

Set `LASTSAAS_ENV=dev` or `LASTSAAS_ENV=prod` to select which config to load. Defaults to `dev`.

Secrets are referenced as `${ENV_VAR}` in YAML and expanded from environment variables at load time. Default values use `${VAR:default}` syntax.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `DATABASE_NAME` | Yes | Project identity — shared name = shared user base |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Yes | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for signing access tokens |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for signing refresh tokens |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Yes | Frontend URL for CORS and email links |
| `APP_NAME` | Yes | Your application name (used in emails, UI) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | No | Stripe secret API key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | No | Stripe publishable key (sent to frontend) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | Stripe webhook signing secret |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | No | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | Google OAuth secret |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL` | No | Google OAuth redirect URL |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | No | Resend email service API key |
| `FROM_EMAIL` | No | Sender email address (default: noreply@yourdomain.com) |

## API Documentation

LastSaaS includes built-in, self-hosted API documentation:

- **Interactive HTML reference**: `GET /api/docs` — expandable endpoint cards with request/response examples
- **Markdown reference**: `GET /api/docs/markdown` — for embedding in external documentation

The documentation is generated from code and always matches the running version. It covers all endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and all 19 webhook event types with payload descriptions.

## MCP Server Setup

The MCP server lets AI assistants query your admin data in natural language. It proxies read-only requests to the LastSaaS admin API using an API key.

### Prerequisites

1. A running LastSaaS instance (local or deployed)
2. A root-tenant API key — create one in **Admin → API Keys** with **admin** authority

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lastsaas": {
      "command": "/path/to/lastsaas",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LASTSAAS_URL": "https://your-app.fly.dev",
        "LASTSAAS_API_KEY": "lsk_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with Claude Code

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lastsaas": {
      "command": "/path/to/lastsaas",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LASTSAAS_URL": "https://your-app.fly.dev",
        "LASTSAAS_API_KEY": "lsk_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Fly.io

LastSaaS includes a Dockerfile and Fly.io configuration for production deployment.

```bash
# Install flyctl if needed
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Create the app (first time only)
flyctl apps create your-app-name --org your-org

# Set production secrets
flyctl secrets set \
  DATABASE_NAME="your-db-name" \
  MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://..." \
  JWT_ACCESS_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  FRONTEND_URL="https://your-app-name.fly.dev" \
  APP_NAME="YourApp" \
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..." \
  STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..." \
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

# Deploy
flyctl deploy
```

The Dockerfile builds both the Go backend and React frontend into a single ~14MB Alpine container. The Go binary serves the frontend SPA directly — no nginx or separate web server required.

### Other Platforms

The Docker image works anywhere containers run. The only external dependency is MongoDB. Set the environment variables listed above and expose port 8080.

## Fork It and Keep Building with AI

LastSaaS was built entirely through conversation with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) — every feature, every handler, every component was described in natural language and implemented by an AI agent. But the real point isn't that it *was* built this way — it's that it's designed to *keep* being built this way.

The codebase follows consistent patterns, uses clear naming, and maintains a structure that AI agents navigate fluently. Fork it, point Claude Code at it, and start describing your product. The agent already understands the patterns — authentication, tenancy, billing, middleware, events — and builds on top of them naturally. You're not starting from scratch; you're continuing a conversation.

Here's what's already wired up for you:

1. **Add your product's data models** in `backend/internal/models/`
2. **Add API handlers** in `backend/internal/api/handlers/`
3. **Wire routes** in `backend/cmd/server/main.go`
4. **Add frontend pages** in `frontend/src/pages/`
5. **Use the tenant context** — every authenticated request carries the user's tenant, so your product logic gets multi-tenancy for free
6. **Use the credit system** — check and deduct credits for usage-based features
7. **Use entitlements** — gate features with `middleware.RequireEntitlement(db, "feature_name")` and `middleware.RequireActiveBilling()`
8. **Use the config store** — add runtime-configurable settings without redeployment
9. **Use the event emitter** — emit events from your handlers and they'll automatically be delivered to configured webhooks
10. **Use API keys** — your endpoints automatically support both JWT and API key authentication
11. **Use the branding system** — your UI inherits the white-label theme automatically via the BrandingContext
12. **Use the telemetry system** — track custom events with `telemetry.Track()` in Go or `POST /telemetry/events` from external clients, and they'll automatically appear in the PM dashboard
